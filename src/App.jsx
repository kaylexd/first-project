      </p>
      <p>
        React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
        building user interfaces based on components by Facebook Inc. It is
        maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and
        companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or
        server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.
